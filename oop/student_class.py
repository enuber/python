# class is a blueprint for pieces of data. Like a mould give it a name and has types of data that are designed exactly as you want. They let you design your own datatypes. 
# objects - when you use the class you are creating objects.
# attributes - are instance variables
# methods - functions inside of a class
# __init__ - can customize the classes object. it is an instance method. Designed to initialize the contents of an object in a class.
# self - has to come first, gives you access to the current object that was just created
#   this installs into the empty object in identically name instance variables. The object is just an instance of the class.
# self.name, self.house - adding variables to objects. 
# raise - a way to throw or "raise" an error, lets the "programmer" know there was a problem. 
# can control what is being installed into the object. 

#__str__ - special method will be called automatic when anytime some other function wants to see a string.  Like print

# can create your own methods, a function built into it. Always has self coming into it so you have access to the current object

  # student is an object of the class Student.

  # this is different... now passing info into the Student class. This way we have more control over the class
  # We are treating Student() as a function passing in name and house. It is a constructor call in this case. It is going to instantiate a students object. It is going to use the class as a "mould". Because you can pass in arguments into the function you can customize the contents of that object. It is a Student blue print that we can use to build different objects as long as we are passing in a name and house which can be different. Where is this function? It is the __init__ that is being called which is the initialization of the object. 
  # can use a try / except to create the Student and in the class it may throw the error if something isn't correct.
